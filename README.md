# running-statistics-from-Barcelona
This project is based on [this amazing design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2218824-Running-statistics-from-Barcelona). I loved the concept and i made it real, just for fun :)
[angular-google-maps directive](https://github.com/angular-ui/angular-google-maps) was used on deep for this project. So if you are interested on cool features like markerLabel or infoBox you can check the code, or open an issue.
